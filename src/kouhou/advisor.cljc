(ns kouhou.advisor
  "organizer — the *contained intelligence node* for kouhou. It takes a fetched
  source item (url + title + raw text, from a registered public-sector /
  public-interest source) and returns a PROPOSAL: one curated briefing (a
  faithful summary + provenance URL + domain/tags), with a confidence. It NEVER
  returns a committed record and NEVER decides publication — the
  PublicInfoGovernor censors every proposal downstream, and only :commit writes
  the SSoT + publishes. Mirrors the `Advisor` protocol shape used by
  tashikame.advisor / tsumugu.mangallm.

  Sealed by construction: the default `mock-advisor` is deterministic (no
  non-deterministic free-write). The real advisor wires `langchain.model`
  against the Murakumo fleet (DEFAULT-PREFERRED per Rider v3.3 §2(i)) — still
  proposal-only, still governor-censored. Aggregate-first: one run = one
  briefing per source digest (not a flood).

  Proposal shape:
    {:summary    str
     :rationale  str
     :briefings  [{:title :summary :source-url :domain :tags :confidence}]
     :effect     :assessment   ; kouhou only ever curates, never actuates
     :confidence 0..1}"
