  "Real app-aozora Publisher for kouhou — creates a record in the
  com.etzhayyim.apps.kouhou.publicBriefing collection on an aozora PDS via the
  AT Protocol com.atproto.repo.createRecord XRPC, authenticated by a depth-1
  self-minted CACAO (the actor's own did:key + a revocable member CACAO leash
  = the off-switch, ADR-2606281500). Ported shape from tsumugu.kotoba /
  tashikame.aozora.

  I/O is injected: an http-fn (default JDK java.net.http, no dependency) and a
  JSON pair passed by the caller, so this namespace stays dependency-free.
  Publication is the actor's own SPEECH (ADR-2606281500) — NOT actuation."
