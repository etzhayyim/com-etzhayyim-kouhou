(ns kouhou.governor
  "PublicInfoGovernor — the independent censor that earns a kouhou proposal the
  right to publish. SEPARATE system from the organizer advisor (defense in
  depth). Mirrors tashikame.governor's shape (HARD → HOLD, no override;
  SOFT → recorded warning, still publishes).

  Doctrine: publication is AUTONOMOUS by default (ADR-2606281500, 種をまく).
  The PublicInfoGovernor is NOT an external operator/Council prior restraint —
  it is kouhou's OWN seed rail (the off-switch is the revocable member CACAO
  leash, not a per-post approval). So:

    HARD violations → HOLD (recorded as a hold, NEVER published)
    SOFT (low conf) → publish, with a :low-confidence transparency tag

  HARD (never publish):
    :no-actuation          proposal :effect ≠ :assessment (kouhou only curates)
    :no-provenance         a briefing with a blank source-url
    :source-not-in-registry a briefing whose source host is NOT in the
                            whitelisted public-sector / public-interest registry
    :commercial-content    ad / sponsored markers in the briefing (off-mission)
    :catastrophe-veto      Rider §2 catastrophe-veto scan hits on briefing text
  SOFT (publish with tag):
    :low-confidence        overall confidence < floor"

  "R0 OFFLINE-TEST FIXTURE ONLY — the old illustrative `*.example.*` hosts.
  This is NOT the live whitelist and is intentionally left unsynced with
  `registry/sources.seed.json` (ADR-2607197800 world-scope expansion, then
  this change's live-fetch wiring): the offline test suite
  (`governor-contract-test` et al.) is written against these fixture hosts on
  purpose, so changing this set would be a silent breaking change to tests
  that have nothing to do with the real registry.

  The REAL runtime whitelist for a live run is
  `(kouhou.live-fetch/registry->host-set (kouhou.live-fetch/load-registry
  \"registry/sources.seed.json\" json/read-str))`, passed in via context
  :registry — see `kouhou.run-live-ingest`. A briefing whose source host is
  NOT in the registry in effect (default-registry when :registry is absent
  from context, else whatever the caller passed) is held
  (:source-not-in-registry)."
